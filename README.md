# Shortest path, Minimum Spanning Tree in a graph

The Dijkstra algorithm for the shortest path in a graph, and the prim's algotithm for the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) are implemented. These implementations use the Min-Heap structure for updating the set of new vertices and extracting the minimum in an efficient way.

## Data.

The graph is expected to be provided as the number of vertives, followed by 1 row per edge. The precise format is as follows: 

```
#number_of_vertices
#extremity1 #extremity2 #weight
#extremity1 #extremity2 #weight
...
```

An example is provided as <code>SampleTestData.txt</code> .
